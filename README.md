Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Project
Overview
This project uses a CNN to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. It implements TensorFlow's tutorials for training and evaluating a CNN model.
Steps to Run
1.	Install required libraries:
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib pillow

Run the main.py script to:
•	Download and preprocess the MNIST dataset.
•	Train the CNN model.
•	Save and visualize 10 sample images and evaluation results.
Outputs
•	Sample images and testing results screenshots.
•	Trained model performance metrics.
